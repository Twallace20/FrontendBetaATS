                <p>
                Growing up in America there was always a stigma that surrounded cannibis. The first time I saw someone in my family was arrested for possession of the plant was when I was 3.
                I didn't understand exactly what was going on but the older and more educated I became on cannabis the more I felt that I would be a change. 
                The inspiration for All The Smoke was and will always remain, to create a world of happiness for everyone to thrive while having their needs conveniently met.
